				<h3>What is Ed's Game?</h3>
				<p>
					Ed's Game is a simple dice game first described in print by John Scarne in
					1945. Players take turns to roll a single die as many times as they
					wish, adding all roll results to a running total, but losing their
					gained score for the turn if they roll a 1.
				</p>
				<h3>Gameplay</h3>
				<p>
					Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled
					or the player decides to "hold": If the player rolls a 1, they score
					nothing and it becomes the next player's turn. If the player rolls any
					other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn
					continues. If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to
					their score, and it becomes the next player's turn. The first player
					to score 20 or more points wins.
